# WSL Notes
## Introduction
I have been doing more WSL work.  These are the notes I have made since there are differencces between normal system administration and WSL usage.

# Files
## Administration
* [Backup_Clone.md](Backup_Clone.md) - Backup, Restore, and Clone a WSL distribution  
* [Autostart_Services.md](Autostart_Services.md) - Autostart services on new WSL instance
* [Enable_USB.md](Enable_USB.md) - Enable USB devices from Windows to WSL

## Development
* [Exec_Windows_Admin.md](Exec_Windows_Admin.md) - Execute commands on the Windows side as a normal user, admin, or arbitrary user  

## Kernel
* [Kernel_Build.md](Kernel_Build.md) - Build a new kernel for WSL systems  
* [Kernel_Enable_USB.md](Kernel_Enable_USB.md) - Enable USB when building a kernel
